# Machine Learning Web App with PyScript

## Overview

This project demonstrates the creation of a machine learning web app using PyScript in your browser. PyScript is a frontend framework that enables users to build interactive websites directly in the browser using Python. This project utilizes HTML, PyScript, and machine learning algorithms to predict car prices based on input features.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this project, you will be able to:

- Describe the key components of the PyScript frontend framework.
- Run machine learning models in your browser.
- Build a simple data visualization web page.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following key components:

- **HTML Document**: `index.html` - Contains the structure of the web page, including HTML elements, PyScript tags, and machine learning input forms.

- **Python Script**: `your_python_script_file.py` - Includes Python code for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

## Core Components of PyScript

### Serverless and Portable

Host web applications on any modern browser without the need for servers or complex configurations.

### Ecosystem Support

Utilize a wide range of Python packages within your web app, such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, and matplotlib.

### Flexible Framework

Link JavaScript and Bootstrap stylesheets to build extensible components like buttons, containers, and widgets.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

3. Explore and interact with the machine learning web app.

## Usage

1. Select x and y variables for data visualization.
2. Choose a chart type (scatterplot, lineplot, distribution, barplot, boxplot).
3. View the generated chart on the web page.
4. Enter car details in the prediction form.
5. Receive the predicted car price based on the machine learning model.
